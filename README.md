# 🚧 Accident Analysis in India

This project performs data analysis on transportation accidents across Indian states using real-world datasets.  
We explore the distribution of accidents by type (road, rail, crossing), identify high-risk areas, and visualize key trends using Python.

## 📌 Features
- Accident distribution by type and state
- Visual insights using matplotlib & pandas
- Data-driven recommendations for traffic safety

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 📁 Output
- Graphs of total deaths by state
- Pie charts showing accident type proportions
- Final PDF report for presentation
